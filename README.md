# Tree-Drawer  
### This is a small art coding project.  
A Java code that draws a tree using a "Recursive Function" and "StdDraw.java Library".  
This tree is very beautiful because almost all the ratios are obtained by the "Golden Ratio":

## How to run
#### You have to enter the desired number of branches in the console.  
(It is recommended that a number be greater than 1 and less than 10; for example, in the image above, the input is 6)  
While running the main function in the main.java file, the canvas window will be displayed.
The canvas window will be displayed when the function StdDraw.setCanvasSize() runs.

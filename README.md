# Tree-Drawer  
A Java project that draws a tree using a "Recursive Function" and "StdDraw.java Library".  
This tree is very beautiful because almost all the values are obtained by the "Golden Ratio":

Note: Do not forget to enter the desired number of branches in the console.  
(It is recommended that a number be greater than 1 and less than 10;  
for example, in the image above, the input is 6)  
While running the main function in the main.java, the canvas window will be displayed.
